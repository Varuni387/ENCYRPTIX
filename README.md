## Description

1) **Number Guessing Game**

    A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Additionally, it provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

2) **Simple Calculator**

   A program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

3) **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

    A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other.

      - *Game Board*: Create a 3x3 grid as the game board
      - *Players*: Assign "X" and "O" to two players
      - *Display Board*: Show the current state of the board
      - *Player Input*: Prompt the current player to enter their move
      - *Update Board*: Update the game board with the player's move
      - *Check for Win*: Check if the current player has won
      - *Check for Draw*: Determine if the game is a draw
      - *Switch Players*: Alternate turns between "X" and "O" players
      - *Display Result*: Show the result of the game( win, draw, or ongoing )
      - *Play Again*: Ask if the players want to play another game

4) **To-Do List**

    A simple console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.
  
      - *Task Input*: Allow users to input tasks they want to add to the list
      - *Add Task*: Implement a function to add tasks to the list
      - *View Tasks*: Display the list of tasks with their status( completed or pending )
      - *Mark Task as Completed*: Allow users to mark tasks as completed
      - *Remove Task*: Provide an option to remove tasks from list
     
5) **Image Processing Tool**

    A tool that allows users to perform various image processing operations like resizing, cropping, and filtering.

      - *Load Image*: Allow users to load an image
      - *Display Image*: Display the loaded image in the application.
      - *Image Filters*: Implement basic image filters like grayscale, blur, and sharpen.
      - *Color Adjustment*: Allow users to adjust image colors, brightness, and contrast.
      - *Crop and Resize*: Provide options to crop and resize the image.
      - *Image Saving*: Enable users to save the processed image.
      - *User Interface*: Design a user-friendly interface for easy interaction
